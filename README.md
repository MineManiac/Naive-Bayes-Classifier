# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This was a project made for Insper Data Science Class.

Made by Matheus Barros and Giulia Sampaio with the help from the Teacher FÃ¡bio Ayres.

## Introduction
We are learning how to apply the Naive Bayes Classifier, programming the machine to train from tweets that we will classify manually, and then test it by letting it classify by itself.

###### First
At first we chose a brand to do our research, which in our case "McDonalds".
Took 1250 to classify it between: very irrelevant, irrelevant, neutral, relevant, very relevant.
