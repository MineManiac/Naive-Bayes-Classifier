# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This was a project made for Insper Data Science Class.

Made by Matheus Barros and Giulia Sampaio with the help from the Teacher FÃ¡bio Ayres.

## Introduction
We are learning how to apply the Naive Bayes Classifier, programming the machine to train from tweets that we will classify manually, and then test it by letting it classify by itself.

## First Step
At first we chose a brand to do our research, which in our case "McDonalds".
Took 1250 tweets, manually classifying it in 5 groups: very irrelevant, irrelevant, neutral, relevant, very relevant; based on the users preference and opinion about Mcdonalds, as less biased as possible.

## Second Step
Creating the Classifier
